      <h1>History of York City F.C. (1908–80)</h1>
      <p>York City Football Club is a professional association football club based in York, England. The history of York City F.C. from 1908 to 1980 covers the period from the club's original foundation, through their reformation and progress in the Football League, to the end of the 1979–80 season.</p>
      <p>Founded in 1908, York City played several seasons in the Northern League and Midland League before going into liquidation during the First World War. The club was reformed in 1922 and was elected to play in the Midland League for 1922–23. After seven seasons in the Midland League, they were elected to play in the Football League for 1929–30, and were placed in the Third Division North. During the Second World War, York played in regional competitions, before the Football League restored its usual competitions in 1946–47. After 14 seasons in the Football League, the club was required to apply for re-election for the first time because they finished 1949–50 at the bottom of the Third Division North. York had their best FA Cup season in 1954–55, when they reached the semi-final; they were defeated by First Division club Newcastle United in a replay.</p>
      <p>York played in the Third Division North until 1958–59, when a league reorganisation placed them in the Fourth Division. The same season, they finished third and won their first-ever promotion, but were relegated after one season. York won another promotion in 1964–65, but were again relegated after one season. The club won a third promotion to the now-unified Third Division in 1970–71, remaining there for the next two seasons on goal average. They were promoted into the Second Division for the first and only time in 1973–74. By mid-October 1974, York were in fifth place—their highest league placing—before finishing 1974–75 in 15th place. They faced two successive relegations in 1976 and 1977, and a 22nd-place finish in the 1977–78 Fourth Division forced the club to apply for re-election.</p>
